/** This object describes the position on faces where a mask should be placed by
  * default.
  *
  * @param point The part of the face relative to which the mask should be
  * placed. One of “forehead”, “eyes”, “mouth”, or “chin”.
  * @param xShift Shift by X-axis measured in widths of the mask scaled to
  * the face size, from left to right. For example, choosing
  * -1.0 will place mask just to the left of the default mask
  * position.
  * @param yShift Shift by Y-axis measured in heights of the mask scaled to
  * the face size, from top to bottom. For example, 1.0 will
  * place the mask just below the default mask position.
  * @param scale Mask scaling coefficient. For example, 2.0 means double
  * size. */
