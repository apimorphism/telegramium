package telegramium.bots

/** This object represents an incoming update. At most one of the optional parameters can be present in any given
  * update.
  *
  * @param updateId
  *   The update's unique identifier. Update identifiers start from a certain positive number and increase sequentially.
  *   This ID becomes especially handy if you're using Webhooks, since it allows you to ignore repeated updates or to
  *   restore the correct update sequence, should they get out of order. If there are no new updates for at least a
  *   week, then identifier of the next update will be chosen randomly instead of sequentially.
  * @param message
  *   Optional. New incoming message of any kind — text, photo, sticker, etc.
  * @param editedMessage
  *   Optional. New version of a message that is known to the bot and was edited
  * @param channelPost
  *   Optional. New incoming channel post of any kind — text, photo, sticker, etc.
  * @param editedChannelPost
  *   Optional. New version of a channel post that is known to the bot and was edited
  * @param inlineQuery
  *   Optional. New incoming inline query
  * @param chosenInlineResult
  *   Optional. The result of an inline query that was chosen by a user and sent to their chat partner. Please see our
  *   documentation on the feedback collecting for details on how to enable these updates for your bot.
  * @param callbackQuery
  *   Optional. New incoming callback query
  * @param shippingQuery
  *   Optional. New incoming shipping query. Only for invoices with flexible price
  * @param preCheckoutQuery
  *   Optional. New incoming pre-checkout query. Contains full information about checkout
  * @param poll
  *   Optional. New poll state. Bots receive only updates about stopped polls and polls, which are sent by the bot
  * @param pollAnswer
  *   Optional. A user changed their answer in a non-anonymous poll. Bots receive new votes only in polls that were sent
  *   by the bot itself.
  * @param myChatMember
  *   Optional. The bot's chat member status was updated in a chat. For private chats, this update is received only when
  *   the bot is blocked or unblocked by the user.
  * @param chatMember
  *   Optional. A chat member's status was updated in a chat. The bot must be an administrator in the chat and must
  *   explicitly specify “chat_member” in the list of allowed_updates to receive these updates.
  * @param chatJoinRequest
  *   Optional. A request to join the chat has been sent. The bot must have the can_invite_users administrator right in
  *   the chat to receive these updates.
