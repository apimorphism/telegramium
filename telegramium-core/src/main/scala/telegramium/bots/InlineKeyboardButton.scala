package telegramium.bots

/** This object represents one button of an inline keyboard. You must use exactly one of the optional fields.
  *
  * @param text
  *   Label text on the button
  * @param url
  *   Optional. HTTP or tg:// url to be opened when button is pressed
  * @param loginUrl
  *   Optional. An HTTP URL used to automatically authorize the user. Can be used as a replacement for the Telegram
  *   Login Widget.
  * @param callbackData
  *   Optional. Data to be sent in a callback query to the bot when button is pressed, 1-64 bytes
  * @param switchInlineQuery
  *   Optional. If set, pressing the button will prompt the user to select one of their chats, open that chat and insert
  *   the bot's username and the specified inline query in the input field. Can be empty, in which case just the bot's
  *   username will be inserted. Note: This offers an easy way for users to start using your bot in inline mode when
  *   they are currently in a private chat with it. Especially useful when combined with switch_pm… actions – in this
  *   case the user will be automatically returned to the chat they switched from, skipping the chat selection screen.
  * @param switchInlineQueryCurrentChat
  *   Optional. If set, pressing the button will insert the bot's username and the specified inline query in the current
  *   chat's input field. Can be empty, in which case only the bot's username will be inserted. This offers a quick way
  *   for the user to open your bot in inline mode in the same chat – good for selecting something from multiple
  *   options.
  * @param callbackGame
  *   Optional. Description of the game that will be launched when the user presses the button. NOTE: This type of
  *   button must always be the first button in the first row.
  * @param pay
  *   Optional. Specify True, to send a Pay button. NOTE: This type of button must always be the first button in the
  *   first row.
