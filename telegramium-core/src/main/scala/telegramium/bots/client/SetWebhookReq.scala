/** @param url
  *   HTTPS url to send updates to. Use an empty string to remove webhook integration
  * @param certificate
  *   Upload your public key certificate so that the root certificate in use can be checked. See our self-signed guide
  *   for details.
  * @param ipAddress
  *   The fixed IP address which will be used to send webhook requests instead of the IP address resolved through DNS
  * @param maxConnections
  *   Maximum allowed number of simultaneous HTTPS connections to the webhook for update delivery, 1-100. Defaults to
  *   40. Use lower values to limit the load on your bot's server, and higher values to increase your bot's throughput.
  * @param allowedUpdates
  *   A JSON-serialized list of the update types you want your bot to receive. For example, specify [“message”,
  *   “edited_channel_post”, “callback_query”] to only receive updates of these types. See Update for a complete list of
  *   available update types. Specify an empty list to receive all update types except chat_member (default). If not
  *   specified, the previous setting will be used. Please note that this parameter doesn't affect updates created
  *   before the call to the setWebhook, so unwanted updates may be received for a short period of time.
  * @param dropPendingUpdates
  *   Pass True to drop all pending updates
