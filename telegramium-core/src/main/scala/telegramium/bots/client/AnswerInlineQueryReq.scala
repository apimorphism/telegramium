import telegramium.bots.InlineQueryResult

/** @param inlineQueryId
  *   Unique identifier for the answered query
  * @param results
  *   A JSON-serialized array of results for the inline query
  * @param cacheTime
  *   The maximum amount of time in seconds that the result of the inline query may be cached on the server. Defaults to
  *   300.
  * @param isPersonal
  *   Pass True if results may be cached on the server side only for the user that sent the query. By default, results
  *   may be returned to any user who sends the same query
  * @param nextOffset
  *   Pass the offset that a client should send in the next query with the same text to receive more results. Pass an
  *   empty string if there are no more results or if you don't support pagination. Offset length can't exceed 64 bytes.
  * @param switchPmText
  *   If passed, clients will display a button with specified text that switches the user to a private chat with the bot
  *   and sends the bot a start message with the parameter switch_pm_parameter
  * @param switchPmParameter
  *   Deep-linking parameter for the /start message sent to the bot when user presses the switch button. 1-64
  *   characters, only A-Z, a-z, 0-9, _ and - are allowed. Example: An inline bot that sends YouTube videos can ask the
  *   user to connect the bot to their YouTube account to adapt search results accordingly. To do this, it displays a
  *   'Connect your YouTube account' button above the results, or even before showing any. The user presses the button,
  *   switches to a private chat with the bot and, in doing so, passes a start parameter that instructs the bot to
  *   return an OAuth link. Once done, the bot can offer a switch_inline button so that the user can easily return to
  *   the chat where they wanted to use the bot's inline capabilities.
