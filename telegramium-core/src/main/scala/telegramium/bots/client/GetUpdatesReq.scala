/** @param offset Identifier of the first update to be returned. Must be
  * greater by one than the highest among the identifiers of
  * previously received updates. By default, updates starting
  * with the earliest unconfirmed update are returned. An update
  * is considered confirmed as soon as getUpdates is called with
  * an offset higher than its update_id. The negative offset can
  * be specified to retrieve updates starting from -offset
  * update from the end of the updates queue. All previous
  * updates will forgotten.
  * @param limit Limits the number of updates to be retrieved. Values
  * between 1-100 are accepted. Defaults to 100.
  * @param timeout Timeout in seconds for long polling. Defaults to 0, i.e.
  * usual short polling. Should be positive, short polling
  * should be used for testing purposes only.
  * @param allowedUpdates A JSON-serialized list of the update types you want your
  * bot to receive. For example, specify [“message”,
  * “edited_channel_post”, “callback_query”] to only receive
  * updates of these types. See Update for a complete list of
  * available update types. Specify an empty list to receive all
  * update types except chat_member (default). If not specified,
  * the previous setting will be used. Please note that this
  * parameter doesn't affect updates created before the call to
  * the getUpdates, so unwanted updates may be received for a
  * short period of time. */
