  *   Optional. Requests clients to always show the keyboard when the regular keyboard is hidden. Defaults to false, in

  * @param resizeKeyboard
  *   Optional. Requests clients to resize the keyboard vertically for optimal fit (e.g., make the keyboard smaller if
  *   there are just two rows of buttons). Defaults to false, in which case the custom keyboard is always of the same
  *   height as the app's standard keyboard.
  * @param oneTimeKeyboard
  *   Optional. Requests clients to hide the keyboard as soon as it's been used. The keyboard will still be available,
  *   but clients will automatically display the usual letter-keyboard in the chat - the user can press a special button
  *   in the input field to see the custom keyboard again. Defaults to false.

  *   chat and forum topic, sender of the original message. Example: A user requests to change the bot's language, bot
  *   replies to the request with a keyboard to select the new language. Other users in the group don't see the
