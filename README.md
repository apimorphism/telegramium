F[Tg] is a pure functional Telegram Bot API for Scala.

This project is a try to provide a comprehensive, well documented and Scala-idiomatic client/server implementations to work with Telegram Bot API. Please refer to telegramium-examples module for usage examples. There is a support both for polling and webhooks.
API core is generated from the official documentation, so it is believed to cover all the available methods, entities and to be up to date.

Currently the following backends are supported:

- http4s
- cats-effect
- circe

You may want to start with [Methods.scala](telegramium-core/src/main/scala/telegramium/bots/client/Methods.scala) and [EchoBot.scala](telegramium-examples/src/main/scala/telegramium/bots/examples/EchoBot.scala).

### How to use
Create the dependency by adding the following lines to your build.sbt:

```
libraryDependencies += "io.github.apimorphism" %% "telegramium-core" % "<version>"
libraryDependencies += "io.github.apimorphism" %% "telegramium-high" % "<version>"
```

Imports:
```scala
import telegramium.bots.high._
import telegramium.bots.high.implicits._
```

Use the `Methods` factory to create requests. You will need an instance of the `BotApi` class to execute them:
```scala
BlazeClientBuilder[F].resource.use { httpClient =>
  implicit val api: Api[F] = BotApi(httpClient, baseUrl = s"https://api.telegram.org/bot$token")
  val bot = new MyLongPollBot()
  bot.start()
}
```

#### Long polling
```scala
class MyLongPollBot[F[_]: Async: Parallel]()(implicit api: Api[F]) extends LongPollBot[F](api) {
  override def onMessage(msg: Message): F[Unit] =
    Methods.sendMessage(chatId = ChatIntId(msg.chat.id), text = "Hello, world!").exec.void
}
```

`LongPollBot` and `WebhookBot` extend the `Methods` trait so you can call `sendMessage` directly.

#### Webhooks
```scala
class MyWebhookBot[F[_]: Async](url: String, path: String)(
  implicit api: Api[F]
) extends WebhookBot[F](api, url, path) {
  override def onMessage(msg: Message): F[Unit] =
    sendMessage(chatId = ChatIntId(msg.chat.id), text = "Hello, world!").exec.void
}
```

You can also perform a request to the Bot API while [sending an answer to the webhook](https://core.telegram.org/bots/api#making-requests-when-getting-updates):
```scala
override def onMessageReply(msg: Message): F[Option[Method[_]]] =
  Sync[F].pure(Some(sendMessage(chatId = ChatIntId(msg.chat.id), text = "Hello, world!")))
```
In addition, the library provides a way to compose multiple Webhook
bots into a single `Http4s` Server that will handle the webhooks
registration as well as the incoming requests of all the composed
bots. You ultimately decide at which host:port the server will be
binded to:

``` scala
val api1: Api[IO] = BotApi(http, baseUrl = s"https://api.telegram.org/bot$bot_token1")
val api2: Api[IO] = BotApi(http, baseUrl = s"https://api.telegram.org/bot$bot_token1")
val bot1: MyWebhookbot = new MyWebhookbot[IO](api1, "ServerVisibleFromOutside", s"/$bot_token1")
val bot2: MyWebhookbot = new MyWebhookbot[IO](api2, "ServerVisibleFromOutside", s"/$bot_token2")

WebhookBot.compose[IO](
    List(bot1, bot2),
    8080,
    "127.0.0.1" //optional, localhost as default
  ).useForever.runSyncUnsafe()
```

For details, have a look
at the [Github Issue](https://github.com/apimorphism/telegramium/issues/143) and
the related [Pull Request](https://github.com/apimorphism/telegramium/pull/145 ).

#### Keyboards
To use smart and safe constructors for keyboard markups, import `telegramium.bots.high.keyboards._`:
```scala
val button: KeyboardButton = KeyboardButtons.text("Hello, world!")
val keyboard: ReplyKeyboardMarkup = ReplyKeyboardMarkups.singleButton(button)

val inlineButton: InlineKeyboardButton =
  InlineKeyboardButtons.callbackData(text = "Press me", callbackData = "button_pressed")

val inlineKeyboard: InlineKeyboardMarkup =
  InlineKeyboardMarkups.singleButton(inlineButton)
```

### Versioning

X.Y.Z where

* X major changes to telegramium high or internals of the core.
* Y denotes Telegram Bot API version which is supported by this `X.Y.Z`.

Please, note, that this versioning scheme is started from version `1.48.0`.

### Contribution

I'd love to have more testing and more example bots. Ideas and PRs on telegramium-high -
high level interface for the bot API are also highly encouraged.

If you want to change something in telegramium-core or found a bug in it, please create an issue.
Do not create pull requests with changes on telegramium-core as we use semi-automatic way to work with it.
Except that any PR-s are welcome.
